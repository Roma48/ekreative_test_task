    Includes:
        Change - I changed a setting in the installation profile for the CKeditor to use the editors default CSS instead of the Admiistrator's theme. This is what was causing the issue with the table borders not appearing in the editor.
        New - I've added the the EDS Directory module... The module is disable by default and can be enabled under the modules page... The module automatically creates a page called /eds/directory and a few taxonomy categories when enabling.

EDsuite V3 - 3.0.6
    Includes:
        Change - Refactored the Startup Theme: I took the startup theme and pulled everything out that I didn't feel needed to be there. It's more of a bare bones skeleton theme with very little theming other than common things we need to get started. I find that Sam and I work much better starting with something very paired down and refined than from an a full existing theme.
        Change - The Page content type was promoting to front page by Default... I fixed this.
        Bug - Add to Report now shows on Property Detail Pages as it should.
        Bug - Was receiving an error on Custom Report page. I fixed this.
        Bug - The 'Remove All Content' from Custom Report wasn't working... I fixed this.
        Change - Custom Report PDF Generation: I've refactored the Custom Report CSS to have a very basic / neutral theme. As it stands now, the /eds/report detail page will use the report.css file found in the CR module PLUS the current theme's style.css file... However, when Printing or converting to PDF using the print module, only the CR's report.css file is utilized. There is currently no way to customize the look of the Print or PDF version per theme without modifying the CR module's CSS file which is a big NO NO. I would like to figure out a way to customize the Print and PDF version per theme without messing with the module, but this will have to happen in a later build as I've already spent time with no success.
